# TMP36
The TMP36 library is a very simple Arduino library that converts the analog values from a TMP36 temperature sensor directly into Celsius and Fahrenheit so you don't have to.
## Using the library
Using the library is very easy, and there are only a few functions to learn.
 * `TMP36 name(pin, voltage)` - Creates an instance of the class where **name** is a name you choose, **pin** is the pin the TMP36 is connected to, and **voltage** is the voltage applied to the sensor(5 for 5v Arduino, 3.3 for 3.3v Arduino).  Check out [this tutorial](https://learn.adafruit.com/tmp36-temperature-sensor?view=all) for more information.
 * `name.getVoltage()` - Returns the voltage
 * `name.getTempF()` - Returns the temperature in Fahrenheit
 * `name.getTempC()` - Returns the temperature in Celsius
 * `name.getTempK()` - Returns the temperature in Kelvin<br />
 
The SerialTemp example included writes the temperature in both scales to the serial monitor.
## New in v1.1.0
New example sketch ConsoleSerialTemp is exactly the same as SerialTemp, but it uses the Console.
## New in v1.2.0
I cleaned up the cpp code to make it a little more efficient, and added the option to specify the voltage applied to the TMP36. 
## New in v1.2.1
Fixed spelling of celsius.
## New in v1.3.0
Added Kelvin because why not.
